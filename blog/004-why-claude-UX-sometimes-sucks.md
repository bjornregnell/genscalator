# 004 — Why Claude's UX sometimes sucks (and how we'd fix it)

**Status: STUB.** TODO: mine WR data for UX problems.

Source material to mine (Workflow-Research "WR data", logged live during real agentic runs):
- `research/wr-data/harness-ux.md` — the primary log. Recurring themes already captured there:
  - **Input races** — arrow-up "edit a just-sent message" → double-post; Enter landing on a confirmation prompt;
    agent-fired modals stealing the human's typing focus; `$(…)` command-substitution tripping the confirmation guard
    then a mis-click on the prompt.
  - **Can't read the gauge when you need it** — `/context` blocked while messages are queued / the agent is mid-turn,
    exactly when a human on a long AFK run wants a fill/rot read without interrupting.
  - **Bash-reflex cluster** — the agent reaches for `ls`/`cat`/`grep`/`echo`-glued compounds instead of typed tools;
    each is a small UX-and-safety papercut (noise, confirmation prompts, lossy composition).
- `research/smart-zone-ceiling.md` — fill-vs-rot, monitor-tick cadence as a rot knob.
- Related memories: harness-double-post-edit-race, no-interrupting-modals-during-flow, propose-compact-dance-at-trigger.

Angle (TODO firm up): these aren't random bugs — most are **one family**: *timing/observability races between a human
action and the system consuming a prior input*, plus *missing typed affordances* that push work into bash. For each,
pair the felt problem with a concrete harness-side ask (widen the edit window; read-only `/context`; a nonblocking
health gauge; typed tools that remove the reflex).

Pairs with the tt-toolbox DESIGN (`tools/DESIGN-single-dispatcher.md`) on the tooling half.
