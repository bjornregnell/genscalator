# WR data — genscalator self-development

**WR = Workflow Research** (see [`README.md`](README.md) for the thesis + field schema). Confirmation
events recorded while developing genscalator *itself* — dogfooding: building the toolbox surfaces the same
dynamic-shell friction the toolbox exists to remove.

| 2026-06-27 | genscalator self-dev | Verify the `tt text grepr` change: run 3 cases (multi-ext, single-ext back-compat, bad-dir) and check the exit code | `echo "=== …"; scala-cli run …/text.scala -- grepr … ; echo "=== …"; scala-cli run … ; echo "exit=$?"` | `;`-chained compound + multiple `echo` headers + `$?` — each `scala-cli run` alone matches `Bash(scala-cli run *)`, but the bundle is **not statically allowlistable**, so it prompts | (1) **rule**: one bare `scala-cli run …` per call — no `echo`/`;`/`$?` scaffolding (the violation was mine: AGENTS.md already says this). (2) **tool**: the roadmapped **run-and-verify driver** — a typed `tt` tool taking `tool + args + expected` that runs it and prints pass/fail, collapsing the echo+run+check bundle into one allowlistable call | rule (+ tool idea → roadmap) |

## Narrative
This event is a clean instance of WR flavour #2 from the introprog case study
([`introprog-autotranslate.md`](introprog-autotranslate.md)): **the bundling itself is the prompt cause**,
not any single command. Twist worth noting — it happened *inside genscalator development*, where the
one-bare-command discipline is literally documented in `AGENTS.md`; momentum still re-introduced the
scaffolding stack. Evidence that command-hygiene needs to be **frictionless/reflexive**, not just written
down. It also adds a concrete data point in favour of building the roadmapped **run-and-verify driver**:
verifying a tool's behaviour is a recurring need that currently invites an `echo`+`;`+`$?` bundle.
